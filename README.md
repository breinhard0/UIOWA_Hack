# FilamentFinancer

FilamentFinancer is a Python-based chatbot project that helps you calculate the cost of 3D printing filament and provides information related to 3D printing. This project uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to generate responses for user queries and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Taipy library.

## Features
Calculate the cost of filament based on user input.
Choose from different filament types, including PLA, PETG, and ABS.
Engage in a conversation with the chatbot to get information on 3D printing topics.
Visualize the average cost of filament over time using charts.
View a table of data related to 3D printing costs.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
The required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
<br>
pip install requests pandas taipy
<br>
Installation
Clone the repository:
<br>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FilamentFinancer.git
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code with your OpenAI GPT-3.5 API key.

### Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Launch the application using the steps described in the installation section.
Choose the filament type (e.g., PLA, PETG, ABS).
Enter the number of grams for your 3D printing job.
Click the "Enter" button to calculate the cost.
Use the chat interface to ask questions or engage in conversations with the chatbot.
Explore the average cost of filament over time using the provided charts and tables.
